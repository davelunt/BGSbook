# Week E: Student-led experiments

This week students can organise their own experiments to conclude the research project. Many students decide to return to the lab and test their predictions of antibiotic resistance by treating the bacteria with antibiotics.

In addition help with the manuscript plan, there will be time with students to translate their course into employability skills for a CV.
