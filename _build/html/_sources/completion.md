# Competing the course

After week E in the lab with student-led experiments the students are almost done.

## Competency Portfolio

Students will need to ensure that their competency portfolio is completed and submitted (25% of course marks). Most students have completed this as they have carried out the work, and it requires little to submit. Their lab book must be submitted as part of this portfolio. 

## Final Manuscript

Lastly they must write and submit the final manuscript which is 50% of the course marks. 

Students are encouraged to submit a draft manuscript for formative feedback 2 weeks before the final submission deadline.
