# Overview of Week A

![week A schedule](../images/weekA_timetable.png)

## Goals of Week A

This week you will

1.  Learn about bacterial genome sequencing through seminars and study

2.  Culture medically relevant bacteria

3.  Gram stain bacteria

4.  Prepare DNA from bacterial isolates

5.  Assess the quality and quantity of your DNA extraction


## Learning and Study

We will teach seminars on bacterial genome sequencing. You will have to
read around this topic. We will set reading on Tuesday and hold a
journal club to discuss the papers on Thursday. You must have read your
papers and be prepared to discuss for this to work. Journal clubs are a
great way to get taught a lot of information very quickly but you will
have to contribute.

## Assessed Portfolio Activities

### Electronic Lab Notebook

This week you will begin your Google Docs electronic lab notebook. You
will familiarise yourself with how to keep a notebook, what to record
and when by viewing examples and discussion with academic staff.

### Competency Portfolio

This week you will have two competencies to document. These are
described in more detail in the manual below.

1.  Bacterial Identification Figure

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

##  Bacterial Identification

We are going to start by culturing bacteria from some clinically
relevant samples, and then using traditional microbiology techniques to
identify those bacteria. There are two techniques we will use:

1.  Culturing onto chromogenic agar

2.  Gram staining and microscopy

**We are not providing you with step-by-step instructions of how to do
this** - we are giving you some background information and materials,
and you need to work out how best to do this so you can achieve the
competency standard.

**You should also culture and Gram stain the two experimental strains we
will use for sequencing, and include these in your
figures.**![](media/image8.png){width="6.1344739720035in"

Incubators available: 37oC, 44oC

### Plating out bacteria

Remember that there are two main methods for plating bacteria - streak
plates and spread plates. You need to decide which is most appropriate.
For both methods you will need to observe good sterile technique.

number of bacteria in a sample

###  

### Gram Staining 

You will perform a Gram-stain test on the bacteria that you have
subcultured. Briefly, the procedure enables you to differentiate
bacteria on the basis of differences in the structure of the bacterial
cell wall, and in particular on the different thicknesses of the
peptidoglycan component. Gram-positive bacteria have a thick
peptidoglycan cell wall, whilst Gram-negative have a thin peptidoglycan
cell wall (Figure 1).

![](media/image2.png){width="4.25in" height="3.375in"}

#### Figure 1. Differences in cell wall structure in Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.

In the Gram-stain test (Figure 2), you undertake a series of staining
steps on bacterial cells that have been 'heat fixed' onto a microscope
slide. Firstly, heat-fixed cells are treated with a solution of Crystal
Violet which is taken up into the cell, staining the cells dark purple.
Secondly, cells are then immersed in Gram's iodine. The iodine forms an
insoluble complex with the Crystal Violet stain. This complex can be
extracted from Gram-negative bacteria by the addition of a solvent such
as alcohol (NB today you will be using 'Gram's Differentiator'), but the
complex is retained within Gram-positive bacteria, as the peptidoglycan
layer is dehydrated by the alcohol, preventing the Crystal-violet-iodine
complex from being removed from the cell. At this stage Gram-positive
cells remain dark purple, whilst Gram-negative cells are colourless.
Finally, cells are washed with the counterstain safranin, which stains
the Gram-negative cells pink, whilst Gram-positive cells remain purple.
Cells can then be viewed using a compound microscope (Figure 3), using
the x100 oil immersion lens.

#### Figure 2. Differential staining of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria using the Gram stain procedure.

Morphology

In addition to distinguishing between bacteria with respect to their
Gram-reaction, the use of microscopy also enables you to describe the
morphology (the form and structure) of cells. Typical cell morphologies
are shown in Figure 4. In this practical you will also be describing the
morphology of your cells, which can also be used as a diagnostic
feature.

> 2\. Using a permanent marker pen, label each of the four slides at one
> end with a name and/or number that will enable you to identify which
> slide corresponds to which bacterial isolate.
>
> 3\. Light your Bunsen burner and rotate the sleeve so that you have a
> bright blue (roaring) flame.
>
> 4\. Hold the inoculation loop by the long handle and then heat the
> small circular 'loop' in the middle of the blue flame, until the loop
> glows bright red.
>
> 5\. Using the flame-sterilised inoculation loop, place a single small
> drop of distilled water onto the centre of the microscope slide by
> dipping the loop into the bottle containing 5ml distilled water and
> then touching the loop onto the glass slide. [NB]{.underline} Only a
> very small drop of water should be used since a larger amount will
> take too long to dry. If you add too much water, wipe the slide clean
> with a clean tissue and start again.
>
> 6\. Hold the inoculation loop by the long handle and then heat the
> small circular 'loop' in the middle of the blue flame, until the loop
> glows bright red.
>
> 7\. Quickly touch the hot surface of the loop onto an un-colonised
> area of the surface of the agar plate that contains the microbial
> colony that you plan to use for the Gram stain.
>
> 8\. Now, touch the loop onto a [single colony]{.underline} that you
> are using for the Gram stain. Ensure that you can see that some of the
> colony has adhered to the loop. It is important [NOT]{.underline} to
> overload the slide for the Gram stain test, therefore, only very
> lightly touch the colony selected. Do not put the inoculation loop
> down on the bench.
>
> 9\. With the inoculation loop carrying the bacteria you have selected,
> now gently smear the cells on the loop into the droplet of water on
> the glass slide. Try to ensure that you maintain only a very small
> smear in the centre of the slide and don't spread it too far. Leave
> the slide to dry on the bench in a place where it will not contact or
> contaminate anything.
>
> 10\. Now sterilise the inoculation loop by heating the 'loop' in the
> middle of the blue flame, until the loop glows bright red. When cool,
> this can then be placed down on the bench.
>
> 11\. It is very important that the smear on the glass slide should be
> dry before doing this next step. Once the smeared droplet of water
> containing the bacteria on the slide has dried, pick up the glass
> slide securely using the forceps. Hold the slide with the smear facing
> upwards and pass the slide briefly through the centre of the Bunsen
> burner blue flame. This will leave a heat-fixed smear of bacterial
> cells on the slide ready for staining. Watch a demonstrator do this
> step first. Take great care when wearing gloves to do this step, to
> avoid a possible burn when passing the slide through the flame. Use
> forceps to handle the slides rather than touching them directly while
> using the Bunsen burner.
>
> 12\. Repeat steps 4-11 for all of the samples on which you will be
> performing a Gram stain.
>
> 13\. Turn off your Bunsen burner - the staining solutions are
> flammable!

### Using the Microscope

The microscope is a key piece of equipment for looking at cells - we
will be developing your microscopy skills throughout this module and
through the rest of your programme. Today we will be doing some pretty
'rough and ready' microscopy to look at our gram stained slides - you
will learn more sophisticated strategies for getting really good images
later in the module.

Video for good microscopy practice:

\[NB your microscope might be slightly different to this, but the basic
design will be the same\].

| Care of the Microscope                                                |
|                                                                       |
| > Please remember that it is a delicate precision instrument -- you   |
| > don't need to be scared of it, but the more carefully you set the   |
| > microscope up the better the quality of your images                 |
|                                                                       |
| -   Never force any control.                                          |
|                                                                       |
| -   Always lift it by grasping the limb firmly.                       |
|                                                                       |
| -   Always replace the plastic cover after use to keep dust off.      |
|                                                                       |
| -   Keep the glass above the light source free from dust and dirt.    |
|                                                                       |
| -   Keep the top lenses of the objectives clean \[lens tissue         |
|     > available -- do not use regular tissue\].                       |
|                                                                       |
| -   Do not attempt to remove or dismantle any component.              |
|                                                                       |
| If you aren't sure what to do, find a demonstrator or the practical   |
| organiser and ask for help.                                           |
+=======================================================================+
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

###  

### Focus the specimen

1.  Set up the microscope with the x4 objective pointing towards the
    > specimen

2.  Put the slide on the stage with the material to be studied on the
    > upper surface of the slide, and clip into place

3.  Switch on the illumination and turn to the lowest brightness setting
    > that is still visible

4.  Use the stage controls to move the slide so that the circle of light
    > falls in the middle of the specimen

5.  While looking at the microscope from the side, move the stage up to
    > its highest position using the coarse focus dial (the large dial)

6.  Look down the right eyepiece of the binocular head (keep left eye
    > shut). Slowly lower the stage using the coarse focus until you see
    > the specimen come roughly into focus

7.  Open both eyes and slide the two eyepieces together or apart until
    > the two images fuse perfectly. Do not strain or squint: keep the
    > eyes relaxed (looking at infinity) or the images will not fuse.

8.  Re-focus with the fine focus (small dial) control if necessary. Note
    > and remember the reading scale; this is your interpupillary
    > distance (average 62mm), which you always set before using any
    > binocular optical instrument.

9.  Once you have a focussed image using the x4 objective, swing the x10
    > objective into place. Do not move the focus dials while doing
    > this - you need to keep the slide in the same place!

10. Adjust the fine focus dial only until the image comes into focus.

11. Once you have focussed using the x10 objective, repeat for the x40
    > objective. Only use the fine focus dial.

Once you have focussed using the x40, you are ready to use the x100
objective to see the individual bacterial cells. However, due to the
optical properties of the microscope you will not get a clear image
looking straight down the x100 lens. You need to add some microscope
immersion oil to get a clear image.

12. Swing the x40 objective lens away from your sample, but do not put
    > the x100 lens into place.

13. Place a drop of immersion oil on the centre of your sample.

14. Swing the x100 objective lens into place. Adjust the fine focus dial
    > until you get a sharp focussed image of the cells. Do not go back
    > to the x40 lens once there is oil on your sample!

15. Once you have finished observing your cells, remember to wipe the
    > x100 lens clean with the special lens tissue - do not use normal
    > tissue as it will damage the microscope.

 

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| REMEMBER                                                              |
|                                                                       |
| You should always start with the lowest power lens (i.e. x4) and      |
| focus your image, then increase to the next power lens (i.e. x10).    |
|                                                                       |
| You might need to adjust the fine focus slightly when you change      |
| lenses, but you shouldn't need to adjust the coarse focus.            |
|                                                                       |
| If you can no longer 'find' your sample because it is really out of   |
| focus, go back to a lower powered lens and start again - you will     |
| never find it by just moving the dials back and forward under a high  |
| powered lens!                                                         |

##  

## Bacterial DNA Extraction

Traditional identification methods for bacteria, such as gram staining,
morphology description, and selective agars, are helpful for getting
general information about a bacterial species of interest; however, they
cannot tell us everything we need to know. Often, we need to be able to
identify bacteria down to the strain level and we can do this in a
matter of days by looking at the genomes of bacteria. In order to
perform genomic analysis we must sequence, or read the bases of, the DNA
from bacterial isolates, such as the plates you streaked earlier this
week. Before DNA can be sequenced though it must be pulled out of the
bacterial cells by performing DNA extraction.

### Cell Lysis

There are a variety of methods used to extract DNA from bacteria, but
the method you will be using is a fairly standard process that utilises
multiple types of cell lysis. This approach can be beneficial because it
can be difficult to break open bacterial cells without destroying their
DNA. Additionally, the differences in morphologies and cell wall
structures of bacterial species means that DNA extraction protocols tend
to be more effective when a variety of approaches is applied. For
instance, the fragility of gram negatives' cell walls make them
particularly vulnerable to **mechanical lysis**, such as the use of
garnet beads and vigorous shaking applied in the methods below.

Mechanical lysis is a common and effective method used for DNA
extraction, but it is not very effective on gram positive species due to
their strong, thick cell walls. Often an additional form of **chemical
lysis** is necessary to break all the layers of peptidoglycan in these
cells. To help you extract DNA from gram positive cells, you will be
using SDS in the **Water Lysis Additive**, which is a detergent, not
unlike a tough dish soap you have at home, that helps break up lipids.
You will also use a form of **enzymatic lysis** to help SDS break the
peptidoglycan layers by putting **Proteinase K** in with your sample.
**Proteinase K** is a protease enzyme that digests proteins and, like
penicillin, was originally discovered in the extracts of a fungus!

![](media/image9.png){width="4.948910761154855in"
height="2.227557961504812in"}

Figure 1: Example of chemical lysis using a detergent, such as SDS.

### Inhibitor Removal

Once all the cells in a sample, such as the colonies you will be
scraping off of your plates, are lysed and the DNA is freely floating,
we must remove any compounds that could affect later steps in our lab
work. Cell lysis leads to the broken bits of cells freely floating in
your sample and involves the use of a variety of chemicals, both of
which may inhibit the solutions we have to use later for sequencing. To
remove these components and clean up your DNA you will be using 2
methods. The first step is using **Flocculant Solution**, an agent that
helps to separate solids, like pieces of cells, and liquids, like the
solution containing your DNA, by compressing tiny particles and forcing
them to sink to the bottom of a container.

compress solids, separating them from a solution's liquid.

Next, to ensure your final solution contains only clean DNA, **solid
phase reversible immobilisation** (SPRI) is implemented. This method
utilises the inherent negative charge of DNA to pull it out of the
solution by adding magnetic beads that have a special surface, which DNA
attaches to and allows us to dispose of the rest of the solution.
Additionally, SPRI is ideal for genome and long read sequencing, such as
Nanopore sequencing, because it is a very gentle method that helps to
select sequences larger than 1kb.

## DNA Extraction Assessment

Once your DNA is extracted and cleaned up, you will have to make sure
there is enough of your DNA and that it is long and clean enough to
sequence. DNA sequencing is an arduous, expensive process and,
therefore, you need to make absolutely sure that the extracted DNA meets
the minimum requirements for the Nanopore sequencing machine. In Week B
your group will be sequencing the DNA that was extracted, but only one
of your 3 samples can go on to be sequenced. Using the methods below for
DNA extraction assessment, you will determine whether your sample meets
the sequencing requirements and, as a group, pick one to go into the
sequencing machine. Your Portfolio Competency 2 will require the results
you produce in this stage to be the evidence of which sample your group
chooses and why.

### Length Estimation

In order to sequence a bacterial genome, your DNA sequences will have to
be quite long. The extraction protocol described below is relatively
gentle and that helps to ensure your DNA is not too broken to eventually
form a whole genome. The average length of your extracted DNA sequences
can be assessed by running it through gel electrophoresis. The DNA
ladder you will be using is for long sequences, like those for genome
sequencing with Nanopore technology, and, therefore, you should see
bands towards the top of your gel. ***The ideal length for your DNA
sequences is equal to or greater than 10-20kb***.

height="4.639628171478565in"}

Figure 4: Example of a gel image with 4 samples, only one of which has
DNA long enough for genome sequencing.

### Quantity of DNA

In addition to having long enough DNA, you have to make sure there is
enough to actually sequence. Too little DNA and there will not be enough
for the device to give you sequences. Too much DNA and you will
essentially overwhelm the device, again preventing it from giving you
sequences. You will use a machine for quantifying DNA, called a **Qubit
fluorometer**, which will measure the concentration of DNA in your
solution (e.g. 13 nanograms of DNA in 1 microliter of Elution Buffer).
***The amount of DNA that you must have to sequence your sample is 25-50
ng/µL.***

Figure 5: General process in Qubit quantification, where a fluorescent
dye that attaches to DNA is added and, once attached, emits a special
signal. The DNA is quantified by measuring the intensity of that signal.

### Quality of DNA

Finally, you must ensure that your DNA is clean enough to be sequenced.
If there are too many salts, proteins, or any other inhibitory compounds
leftover from DNA extraction, your DNA cannot be sequenced. You will be
using a **Nanodrop spectrophotometer** to determine whether your sample
is clean enough. This machine passes an ultraviolet light through your
sample and measures the light that passes through, the absorbance is
measured and plotted. Your results will be a plot with the absorbance on
the y-axis and the wavelength in nanometers on the x-axis. ***Ideally,
your plot will look very similar to the one shown below, which shows
that there is a lot of DNA and very little of anything else.***

Figure 6: Plot of spectrophotometer results from a nanodrop machine with
the absorbance range (10mm equivalent) as the y-axis and the wavelength
in nanometers as the x-axis. DNA and RNA are shown to have a high level
of absorbance at 260 nm, while salts have a low absorbance at 230 nm and
proteins have a low absorbance at 280 nm.

before preparing your samples for sequencing (Week B). This will also be
used to prepare Portfolio Competency 2.

Equipment required

2.  Gel tray

3.  Gel comb

4.  Melted agarose

5.  Electrophoresis tanks

Each group of three students will have a workstation for the next
section of research. In the end, only one sample from each group will be
used for sequencing, but for this next bit of lab work each student will
use the protocols below to assess the DNA extraction you performed
previously. While you should be working the sample you extracted for the
next steps, the total number of samples for your group should be used
for calculations. The work in this protocol should be split up within
your group by the samples you worked with previously, but the working
solutions made in these protocols should be shared in your group. At
each workstation, there are the following materials:

1.  Appropriate pipettes and pipette tips (P1000, P200, P20, P10, and
    > P2)

2.  Gel tray

3.  Gel comb

4.  A breaker of agarose

5.  Masking tape

6.  Pen

7.  PCR strip tubes

8.  GeneRuler 1kb Plus DNA Ladder

9.  Gel electrophoresis loading dye

10. 1.5 LoBind tubes

11. 10mL tube

12. Qubit tubes

13. Elution buffer

14. Qubit buffer

15. Qubit dye

To assess the quality of your DNA extraction we will use three methods:

### Gel Electrophoresis

Remove extracted DNA from the freezer, allowing it to reach room
temperature, and watch a demonstration of how to pour a gel before
starting.

1.  Seal the ends of your gel tray with tape and place the comb at the
    > top to create a row of wells.

2.  If it hasn't already been added, get one of the technicians to add
    > the **GelRed stain** to your agarose. Take the melted agarose
    > provided and pour steadily into the tray avoiding bubbles.

3.  Allow to set for 20-30 minutes

4.  Remove the combs carefully and take off the sealing tape being
    > careful that the gel doesn't slip out of the tray.

5.  Place the tray and gel in the electrophoresis tank (power connection
    > on the right) with the wells furthest from you and slowly fill
    > with **sodium borate** running buffer until the gel is just
    > submerged.

6.  Put 5 µL of extracted DNA into a PCR strip tube.

7.  Load 5 µL of the **GeneRuler 1kb Plus DNA ladder (diluted 1:1)**
    > into the first lane of the gel.

8.  Add 1 µL of **loading dye** to the 5 µL of extracted DNA, mix and
    > load 6 µL of this onto your gel. Record the order of loaded
    > samples onto the templates by each gel tank

9.  Place on the lid and ask a demonstrator to connect to the power
    > supply at \~150 volts.

10. Run the gel for \~90 minutes at 200V

11. After the gel has been removed and washed you will be called up to
    > take a gel photo.

12. Annotate your photograph with the contents of each lane and the size
    > of your bands. Are the bands the expected sizes? Does your DNA
    > meet sequencing requirements?

### Qubit Quantification

To accurately quantify all species of interest, DNA quantification using
Qubit will be performed on both the initial DNA extracted from your
plate and on a 1 in 10 dilution of each sample. Remove **DNA Standard #1
and #2** from the freezer and allow them to reach room temperature
before beginning.

1.  Add 1 µL of extracted DNA to 9 µL of **Elution Buffer** in a 1.5 ml
    > LoBind tube to create the 1 in 10 dilution for each sample.

2.  Put 5 µL of the 1 in 10 dilution into a PCR strip tube.

3.  Put 5 µL of extracted DNA into a PCR strip tube.

4.  Calculate the amount of **Qubit buffer** required using this

### Nanodrop Quality Assessment

A demonstrator will set up the Nanodrop software and blank the machine
for your group, then, after you measure your samples, your results will
be sent to you.

1.  As shown by the demonstrator, use a KIMTECH wipe to wipe the sensor
    > and sampling arm.

2.  Gently place 2 µL of your extracted DNA onto the sensor (as shown
    > below and by the demonstrator).

3.  Lower the sampling arm and the demonstrator will run the analysis.

4.  Repeat this process with your 1 in 10 dilution.
