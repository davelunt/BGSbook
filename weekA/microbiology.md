## Goals of Week A

This week you will:

- Learn about bacterial genome sequencing through seminars and study
- Culture medically relevant bacteria
- Gram stain bacteria
- Prepare DNA from bacterial isolates
- Assess the quality and quantity of your DNA extraction

## Learning and Study

We will teach seminars on bacterial genome sequencing. You will have to read around this topic. We will set reading on Tuesday and hold a journal club to discuss the papers on Thursday. You must have read your papers and be prepared to discuss for this to work. Journal clubs are a great way to get taught a lot of information very quickly but you will have to contribute.

## Assessed Portfolio Activities

### Electronic Lab Notebook

This week you will begin your Google Docs electronic lab notebook. You will familiarise yourself with how to keep a notebook, what to record and when by viewing examples and discussion with academic staff.

### Competency Portfolio

This week you will have two competencies to document. These are described in more detail in the manual.

- Bacterial Identification Figure 
- DNA Extraction (quantity/quality/length) Figures
